When bananas are reduced to 2000 then the Camel can shift them to another point in 2 trips and when the
number of bananas left is &lt;= 1000, then he should not return and only move forward.
In the first part, P1, to shift the bananas by 1Km, the Camel will have to
1. Move forward with 1000 bananas – Will eat up 1 banana in the way forward
2. Leave 998 bananas after 1 km and return with 1 banana – will eat up 1 banana on the way back
3. Pick up the next 1000 bananas and move forward – Will eat up 1 banana on the way forward
4. Leave 998 bananas after 1 km and return with 1 banana – will eat up 1 banana on the way back
5. Will carry the last 1000 bananas from point a and move forward – will eat up 1 banana
Note: After point 5 the Camel does not need to return to point A again.
So, to shift 3000 bananas by 1km, the Camel will eat up to 5 bananas.
After moving to 200 km the Camel would have eaten up 1000 bananas and is now left with 2000 bananas.
Now in Part P2, the Camel needs to do the following to shift the Bananas by 1km.
1. Move forward with 1000 bananas – Will eat up 1 banana in the way forward
2. Leave 998 bananas after 1 km and return with 1 banana – will eat up this 1 banana on the way
back
3. Pick up the next 1000 bananas and move forward – Will eat up 1 banana on the way forward
Note: After point 3 the Camel does not need to return to the starting point of P2.
So, to shift 2000 bananas by 1km, the Camel will eat up 3 bananas.
After moving to 333 km the camel would have eaten up 1000 bananas and is now left with the last 1000
bananas.
The Camel will actually be able to cover 333.33 km, Hence the length of part P2 is 333 Km.
Now, for the last part, P3, the Camel only has to move forward. He has already covered 533 (200+333) out of
1000 km in Parts P1 &amp; P2. Now he has to cover only 467 km and he has 1000 bananas.
He will eat up 467 bananas on the way forward, and at point B the Camel will be left with only 533 Bananas.
